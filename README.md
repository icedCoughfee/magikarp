# magikarp

Magikarp is a GraphQL API wrapper for the public [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) REST API. It is built on top of a [Nikolas Burk's](https://github.com/nikolasburk) GraphQL [boilerplate](https://github.com/nikolasburk/graphql-rest-wrapper). His example guide can be found [here](https://medium.com/@graphcool/how-to-wrap-a-rest-api-with-graphql-8bf3fb17547d).

> This project is purely to learn GraphQL and to support future front-end projects that query the PokeAPI

git clone git@github.com:icedCoughfee/magikarp.git
